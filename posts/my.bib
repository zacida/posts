  abstract = {Abalone is a protein structure that can be used to determine a person's age based on their bone composition. Predicting the age of the abalone will be pragmatic in determining when that organism possessed life. The primary objective of this work is to enable Scientists and Zoo Archaeologists to understand this concept in a deeper way. While utilizing the typical machine learning model in the research, we discovered that the results were unsatisfactory, thus we suggested an improved ensemble model that works with both lazy and eager machine learning algorithms. When comparing and validating the performance of the proposed model with that of traditional models, the result reveals that the new model is more accurate and was improved to 90.44\%.},

We present a precise and an efficient method for converting data to a computable version through binary encoding and normalization. We experiment with various topological variances in neural network architectures, convolutional approach to the task at hand and recently succeeding residual neural network architecture for finding the optimal prediction accuracy and efficiency. Although the conventional machine learning methods showed success in this field, our deep learning model tests yield an accuracy of 79.09\% accuracy, surpassing the conventional machine learning algorithms as we incorporated methods for preventing over-fitting and methods for normalizing the output throughout the network.},

  abstract = {Culminating in the year 2002, a global shift in both abalone availability and distribution occurred. Country by country abalone reporting by FAO for both wild caught and cultured abalone changes significantly when further dissected and standardized. The FAO practice of reporting totals for "abalone shucked or not" and the continuing practice of some countries that still report their production by large groups of species, distorts both historical and current totals. Further review shows that the overall world supply of abalone, as a result of continuing increases in cultured production, combined with an unfortunate continued increase in the illegal wild catch is approaching the historical abalone abundance of the mid 1970s. However, major shifts have occurred when these dynamic changes are analyzed. These significant shifts demand inventive thinking on the supply side if prices are to remain at strong levels. Examples are given of approaches employing new creativity in the world of abalone marketing, distribution, and processing.},

  abstract = {Concerns of inaccuracy or bias associated with current techniques used to obtain age and growth data for abalone (age from shell layers, growth from tag-recapture, modal progression) have prompted consideration of alternative techniques to obtain data to ensure sustainable management of abalone fisheries. Stable oxygen isotopes have been used in many studies of molluscan age and growth, but to date this technique has not been applied to haliotids. Here we describe the procedure as applied to the blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra in south-east Tasmania. Stable oxygen isotope ratios of serial samples from calcium carbonate collected at approximately 1\textendash 4mm intervals along the growth direction of the shell reflected the seasonal temperature cycle. From these oscillations, estimates of age and growth were obtained for two specimens, shell length 63.6 and 87.2mm. We determined the age of these specimens to be 3.5 and 5 years. Growth rates ranged between 13 and 19mmyear-1. This study demonstrates the potential of stable oxygen isotopes to validate existing techniques used to determine age and growth of abalone, and could provide further insights into age and growth processes of haliotids.},

  abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) has been widely used to speed up data prediction operations with over thousands of features available. In this paper, we propose a regression-based ANN model with three hidden layers to predict the age of abalones. It is salient to predict abalone age as it helps farmers and sellers to determine the market price of abalones. The economic value of abalone is positively correlated with their respective ages. The age of the abalone can be estimated by measuring the number of layers of shell rings The model was built based on a dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Before developing and training the model, a pre-processing methodology was applied to the dataset. Parameters tuning, which involves modifications in the number of hidden layers as well as the number of epochs, were done to obtain the best result. The finalised results were analysed and the results show that physical measurements of abalone can predict its respective age with less time consumption. This study has shown a result of low root mean-squared error, obtained from the proposed model in comparison with other methods stated in this study. Finally, the proposed model was validated using test dataset, and the results reveal a lower root-mean-squared error value in contrast to the value obtained during model training.},

Illegal exploitation, particularly in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and California, is still a major problem reaching an estimated 7,000 mt in the 2016/17 period. A positive development that partially counteracts the illegal exploitation has been the establishment of restoration and ranching operations in various countries around the world. Taking all sources of abalone into account (fished, farmed, and illegal), it is estimated that in 2017, the total availability of abalone to the world market was 174,162 mt.}
